## üßëüèº‚ÄçüöÄ You're on my space.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about rockets, the universe, and everything in between. As a fan of space exploration and Kerbal Space Program (KSP), I love diving into the science and engineering that make interstellar travel possible.

### The Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation


At the heart of rocket science is the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation, which elegantly describes the relationship between a spacecraft's velocity change (Œîv), exhaust velocity (·µÜ5), and the initial and final mass of the rocket:

![Rocket Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20v%20%3D%20v_%7B%5Ctext%7Be%7D%7D%20%5Cln%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_%7B0%7D%7D%7Bm_%7Bf%7D%7D%20%3D%20I_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsp%7D%7D%20g_%7B0%7D%20%5Cln%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_%7B0%7D%7D%7Bm_%7Bf%7D%7D)

This equation is a cornerstone of spaceflight, guiding mission planning and spacecraft design.
